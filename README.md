# Shopping site made while watching a Skill Share class

## About the project

The images and the appearance of the site came from the project of a Skill Share course for front-end beginners (https://skl.sh/3DVhV4I). I improved it by adding extra characteristics for the site using javascript.

## Technologies used

Only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create this project.

I used local storage for data persistence. I honestly don't know if this is a good practice, but the most important is that I did it all only for learning. I'm quite happy with the result :)
