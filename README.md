# Shopping site made while watching a Skill Share class

## About the project

The images and the appearance of the site came from the project of a Skill Share course for front-end beginners (https://skl.sh/3DVhV4I). I improved it by adding extra characteristics for the site using javascript.

## Technologies used

Only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create this project.

I used local storage for data persistence. I honestly don't know if this is a good practice, but the most important is that I did it all only for learning. I'm quite happy with the result :)

### How to make this project better

1. Make the site look prettier;
2. Make it possible to add more than one of each item ( currently it's not possible since it's using the product's name as a key to local store, and if a new key has the name of a current key, it just gets overwritten, it seems. Maybe it can be overcome by adding some sort of id (but it's probably better to use a database instead of overcomplicating with local storage));
3. Create a payment page and add behave to the buy button!
